# GdxDemo3D #

This is a fork of Johannes SjÃ¶lund's [GdxDemo3D](https://github.com/jsjolund/GdxDemo3D), unfortunately paused for lack of time by its author.
This fork provides updates of this project for recent JDKs and 2021 GDX API.

GdxDemo3D is a game project built with [libGDX](https://github.com/libgdx), demonstrating various aspects of the game library, as well as its extensions, such as the physics engine [Bullet](http://bulletphysics.org/) wrapper and the artificial intelligence library [gdx-ai](https://github.com/libgdx/gdx-ai).

A simple 3D world is included, with a multi storey house and various other items.

Animated human and dog characters are used as actors in the world. Ragdoll physics allows for dynamic character animation when a human falls down.

The [gdx-ai pathfinding](https://github.com/libgdx/gdx-ai/wiki/Pathfinding) module in conjunction with a navigation mesh handles pathfinding, the [gdx-ai steering behaviors](https://github.com/libgdx/gdx-ai/wiki/Steering-Behaviors) module handles character movement while [state machines](https://github.com/libgdx/gdx-ai/wiki/State-Machine) and [behavior trees](https://github.com/libgdx/gdx-ai/wiki/Behavior-Trees) are used to model human and dog brains respectively.

The Bullet physics library is used to handle collisions and forces between objects.

Objects in the world can be modified directly in Blender and exported into the game with an automated script.

## To get started ##

First of all one needs to retrieve an up-to-date version of the Behaviour Tree Editor v2 (bte2) project.
Original Piotr Jastrzebski's [repo](https://github.com/piotr-j/bte2) being stale at the time of writing (no code update since 5 years at the time of writing),
the recommended fork is [Berstanio's](https://github.com/Berstanio/bte2)

Retrieve it, and install it in your local gradle cache with the following commands:

```
git clone git@github.com:Berstanio/bte2.git
cd bte2
./gradlew install
```

Next go into your `GdxDemo3D` folder.
`cd GdxDemo3D`

On a system with the `make` command available (virtually all POSIX systems; even on recent Windows systems, `make` can be installed
with the [chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) package manager)
`make start`

If `make` is not available, on can use `gradlew` directly:
`./gradlew desktop:run`

## IDE support ##
