# GdxDemo3D #

This is a fork of Johannes SjÃ¶lund's [GdxDemo3D](https://github.com/jsjolund/GdxDemo3D), unfortunately paused for lack of time by its author.
This fork provides updates of this project for recent JDKs and 2021 GDX API.

## To get started ##

First of all one needs to retrieve an up-to-date version of the Behaviour Tree Editor v2 (bte2) project.
Original Piotr Jastrzebski's [repo](https://github.com/piotr-j/bte2) being stale at the time of writing (no code update since 5 years at the time of writing),
the recommended fork is [Berstanio's](https://github.com/Berstanio/bte2)

Retrieve it, and install it in your local gradle cache with the following commands:

```
git clone git@github.com:Berstanio/bte2.git
cd bte2
./gradlew install
```

Next go into your `GdxDemo3D` folder.
`cd GdxDemo3D`

On a system with the `make` command available (virtually all POSIX systems; even on recent Windows systems, `make` can be installed
with the [chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) package manager)
`make start`

If `make` is not available, on can use `gradlew` directly:
`./gradlew desktop:run`
